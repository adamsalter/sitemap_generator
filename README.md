SitemapGenerator
================

SitemapGenerator generates Sitemaps for your Rails application.  The Sitemaps adhere to the [Sitemap 0.9 protocol][sitemap_protocol] specification.  You specify the contents of your Sitemap using a configuration file, à la Rails Routes.  A set of rake tasks is included to help you manage your Sitemaps.

Features
-------

- Supports [Video sitemaps][sitemap_video] and [Image sitemaps][sitemap_images]
- Rails 2.x and 3.x compatible
- Adheres to the [Sitemap 0.9 protocol][sitemap_protocol]
- Handles millions of links
- Compresses Sitemaps using GZip
- Notifies Search Engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ask, SitemapWriter) of new sitemaps
- Ensures your old Sitemaps stay in place if the new Sitemap fails to generate
- You set the hostname (and protocol) of the links in your Sitemap

Foreword
-------

Adam Salter first created SitemapGenerator while we were working together in Sydney, Australia.  Unfortunately, he passed away in 2009.  Since then I have taken over development of SitemapGenerator.

Those who knew him know what an amazing guy he was, and what an excellent Rails programmer he was.  His passing is a great loss to the Rails community.

The canonical repository is now: [http://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator][canonical_repo]

Install
=======

**Rails 3:**

1. Add the gem to your `Gemfile`

      gem 'sitemap_generator'

2. `$ rake sitemap:install`

You don't need to include the tasks in your `Rakefile` because the tasks are loaded for you.

**Pre Rails 3: As a gem**

1. Add the gem as a dependency in your <tt>config/environment.rb</tt>

      config.gem 'sitemap_generator', :lib => false

2. `$ rake gems:install`

3. Add the following to your `Rakefile`

      begin
        require 'sitemap_generator/tasks'
      rescue Exception => e
        puts "Warning, couldn't load gem tasks: #{e.message}! Skipping..."
      end

4. `$ rake sitemap:install`

**Pre Rails 3: As a plugin**

1. `$ ./script/plugin install git://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator.git`

Usage
======

<code>rake sitemap:install</code> creates a <tt>config/sitemap.rb</tt> file which contains your logic for generating the Sitemap files.

Once you have configured your sitemap in <tt>config/sitemap.rb</tt> (see Configuration below) run <code>rake sitemap:refresh</code> as needed to create/rebuild your Sitemap files.  Sitemaps are generated into the <tt>public/</tt> folder and are named <tt>sitemap_index.xml.gz</tt>, <tt>sitemap1.xml.gz</tt>, <tt>sitemap2.xml.gz</tt>, etc.

Using <code>rake sitemap:refresh</code> will notify major search engines to let them know that a new Sitemap is available (Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ask, SitemapWriter).  To generate new Sitemaps without notifying search engines (for example when running in a local environment) use <code>rake sitemap:refresh:no_ping</code>.

To ping Yahoo you will need to set your Yahoo AppID in <tt>config/sitemap.rb</tt>.  For example: <code>SitemapGenerator::Sitemap.yahoo_app_id = "my_app_id"</code>

To disable all non-essential output (only errors will be displayed) run the rake tasks with the <code>-s</code> option.  For example <code>rake -s sitemap:refresh</code>.

Cron
-----

To keep your Sitemaps up-to-date, setup a cron job.  Make sure to pass the <code>-s</code> option to silence rake.  That way you will only get email when the sitemap build fails.

If you're using Whenever, your schedule would look something like the following:

    # config/schedule.rb
    every 1.day, :at => '5:00 am' do
      rake "-s sitemap:refresh"
    end

Robots.txt
----------

You should add the Sitemap index file to <code>public/robots.txt</code> to help search engines find your Sitemaps.  The URL should be the complete URL to the Sitemap index file.  For example:

    Sitemap: http://www.example.org/sitemap_index.xml.gz

Image Sitemaps
-----------

Images can be added to a sitemap URL by passing an <tt>:images</tt> array to <tt>add()</tt>.  Each item in the array must be a Hash containing tags defined by the [Image Sitemap][image_tags] specification.  For example:

    sitemap.add('/index.html', :images => [{ :loc => 'http://www.example.com/image.png', :title => 'Image' }])

Supported image options include:

* `loc` Required, location of the image
* `caption`
* `geo_location`
* `title`
* `license`

Video Sitemaps
-----------

A video can be added to a sitemap URL by passing a <tt>:video</tt> Hash to <tt>add()</tt>.  The Hash can contain tags defined by the [Video Sitemap specification][video_tags].  To associate more than one <tt>tag</tt> with a video, pass the tags as an array with the key <tt>:tags</tt>.

    sitemap.add('/index.html', :video => { :thumbnail_loc => 'http://www.example.com/video1_thumbnail.png', :title => 'Title', :description => 'Description', :content_loc => 'http://www.example.com/cool_video.mpg', :tags => %w[one two three], :category => 'Category' })

Supported video options include:

* `thumbnail_loc` Required
* `title` Required
* `description` Required
* `content_loc` Depends.  At least one of `player_loc` or `content_loc` is required
* `player_loc` Depends. At least one of `player_loc` or `content_loc` is required
* `expiration_date` Recommended
* `duration` Recommended
* `rating`
* `view_count`
* `publication_date`
* `family_friendly`
* `tags` A list of tags if more than one tag.
* `tag` A single tag.  See `tags`
* `category`
* `gallery_loc`
    
Configuration
======

The sitemap configuration file can be found in <tt>config/sitemap.rb</tt>.  When you run a rake task to refresh your sitemaps this file is evaluated.  It contains all your configuration settings, as well as your sitemap definition.

Sitemap Links
----------

The Root Path <tt>/</tt> and Sitemap Index file are automatically added to your sitemap.  Links are added to the Sitemap output in the order they are specified.  Add links to your sitemap by calling <tt>add_links</tt>, passing a black which receives the sitemap object.  Then call <tt>add(path, options)</tt> on the sitemap to add a link.

For Example:

    SitemapGenerator::Sitemap.add_links do |sitemap|
      sitemap.add '/reports'
    end

The Rails URL helpers are automatically included for you if Rails is detected.  So in your call to <tt>add</tt> you can use them to generate paths for your active records, e.g.:

    Article.find_each do |article|
      sitemap.add article_path(article), :lastmod => article.updated_at
    end

For large sitemaps it is advisable to iterate through your Active Records in batches to avoid loading all records into memory at once.  As of Rails 2.3.2 you can use <tt>ActiveRecord::Base#find_each</tt> or <tt>ActiveRecord::Base#find_in_batches</tt> to do batched finds, which can significantly improve sitemap performance.

Valid [options to <tt>add</tt>](http://sitemaps.org/protocol.php#xmlTagDefinitions) are:

* `priority`  The priority of this URL relative to other URLs on your site. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0.  Default _0.5_
* `changefreq`  One of: always, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, never. Default _weekly_
* `lastmod` Time instance. The date of last modification.  Default `Time.now`
* `host` Optional host for the link's URL.  Defaults to `default_host`
    
Sitemaps Path
----------

By default sitemaps are generated into <tt>public/</tt>.  You can customize the location for your generated sitemaps by setting <tt>sitemaps_path</tt> to a path relative to your public directory.  The directory will be created for you if it does not already exist.

For example:

    SitemapGenerator::Sitemap.sitemaps_path = 'sitemaps/'

Will generate sitemaps into the `public/sitemaps/` directory.  If you want your sitemaps to be findable by robots, you need to specify the location of your sitemap index file in your <tt>public/robots.txt</tt>.

Sitemaps Host
----------

You must set the <tt>default_host</tt> that is to be used when adding links to your sitemap.  The hostname should match the host that the sitemaps are going to be served from.  For example:

    SitemapGenerator::Sitemap.default_host = "http://www.example.com"

The hostname must include the full protocol.

Example Configuration File
---------

    SitemapGenerator::Sitemap.default_host = "http://www.example.com"
    SitemapGenerator::Sitemap.yahoo_app_id = nil # Set to your Yahoo AppID to ping Yahoo

    SitemapGenerator::Sitemap.add_links do |sitemap|
      # Put links creation logic here.
      #
      # The Root Path ('/') and Sitemap Index file are added automatically.
      # Links are added to the Sitemap output in the order they are specified.
      #
      # Usage: sitemap.add path, options
      #        (default options are used if you don't specify them)
      #
      # Defaults: :priority => 0.5, :changefreq => 'weekly',
      #           :lastmod => Time.now, :host => default_host

      # add '/articles'
      sitemap.add articles_path, :priority => 0.7, :changefreq => 'daily'

      # add all articles
      Article.all.each do |a|
        sitemap.add article_path(a), :lastmod => a.updated_at
      end

      # add news page with images
      News.all.each do |news|
        images = news.images.collect do |image|
          { :loc => image.url, :title => image.name }
        end
        sitemap.add news_path(news), :images => images
      end
    end

Raison d'être
-------

Most of the Sitemap plugins out there seem to try to recreate the Sitemap links by iterating the Rails routes. In some cases this is possible, but for a great deal of cases it isn't.

a) There are probably quite a few routes in your routes file that don't need inclusion in the Sitemap. (AJAX routes I'm looking at you.)

and

b) How would you infer the correct series of links for the following route?

    map.zipcode 'location/:state/:city/:zipcode', :controller => 'zipcode', :action => 'index'

Don't tell me it's trivial, because it isn't. It just looks trivial.

So my idea is to have another file similar to 'routes.rb' called 'sitemap.rb', where you can define what goes into the Sitemap.

Here's my solution:

    Zipcode.find(:all, :include => :city).each do |z|
      sitemap.add zipcode_path(:state => z.city.state, :city => z.city, :zipcode => z)
    end

Easy hey?

Other Sitemap settings for the link, like `lastmod`, `priority`, `changefreq` and `host` are entered automatically, although you can override them if you need to.

Compatibility
=======

Tested and working on:

- **Rails** 3.0.0
- **Rails** 1.x - 2.3.8
- **Ruby** 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.8.7 Enterprise Edition, 1.9.1

Notes
=======

1) New Capistrano deploys will remove your Sitemap files, unless you run `rake sitemap:refresh`. The way around this is to create a cap task to copy the sitemaps from the previous deploy:

    after "deploy:update_code", "deploy:copy_old_sitemap"

    namespace :deploy do
      task :copy_old_sitemap do
          run "if [ -e #{previous_release}/public/sitemap_index.xml.gz ]; then cp #{previous_release}/public/sitemap* #{current_release}/public/; fi"
      end
    end

Known Bugs
========

- There's no check on the size of a URL which [isn't supposed to exceed 2,048 bytes][sitemaps_xml].
- Currently only supports one Sitemap Index file, which can contain 50,000 Sitemap files which can each contain 50,000 urls, so it _only_ supports up to 2,500,000,000 (2.5 billion) urls. I personally have no need of support for more urls, but plugin could be improved to support this.

Wishlist & Coming Soon
========

- Support for read-only filesystems
- Support for plain Ruby and Merb sitemaps
